                <p> I had the opportunity to play Undertale by Toby Fox around this time and was greatly inspired by what he made. So I decided to make my own version using Unity.
                Unsavable is an rpg with its own story, cutscenes, interractive block puzzles, mazes, teleportors, and bullet-hell battles.
                This was also my first time using Unity so every system implemented required a decent amount of research and testing to be constructed. Below is a list of some of the features 
                I was able to implement into the game.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cutscenes: I created a customizable script that allowed me to create every cutscene in the game. The script performs a sequence of commands which I can customize 
                        to create a cutscene. Examples of commands include npc movement, camera movement, music change, sound effects, dialogue, animations, object teleportors, etc. 
                        By properly sequencing these commands, I was able to create numerous cutscences for the game.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Battles: This functions similarly to cutscenes as it also performs a sequence of commands (bullet hell, dialogue, and typerracer) which I can customize to create 
                        any battle. You can also customize how each bullet-hell sequence would play out by positioning obstacles and setting timers. For the typerracer, you can type out using 
                        any key on the keyboard and set the timer and it would work perfectly (of course it took a while to make the typerracer system itself).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Interactive Objects: There are several objects that could be interacted to give dialogue. The special ones are those that move a pile of books or slides a chair until 
                        it collides with something. The books and chairs had various bugs that required fixing such as players could move multiple books at once, books could glitch during 
                        movement making it unaligned, chairs pushing players into the wall, etc.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Menu: A menu system that allowed you to save the game in a file on your computer so you could continue from where you left off. You could also reset the game, 
                        allowing you to play through the story the game again.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Music: All the music in the game was amateurishly written in MuseScore by me. Usually it took several days for me to create a piece I'm satisfied with but because of my piano
                        background, I think most pieces defaulted to using the piano. I'm not too sure what genres I've covered but the songs were made to match the mood of the situation or the
                        character's personality.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Art: All the art (except the font) is also amateurishly created by me in photoshop and paint. Due to my lack of experience in art, I defaulted to pixel art to draw 
                        my characters pixel by pixel using the mouse. I also did this because Undertale had a similar artstyle.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>At the end of the school year, I proudly shared my 3 hour long game to all my collegues at school who all thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

            <h1 class="project-name">"Recursive TicTacToe" Unity Game</h1>
            <h2 class="date">December 2020 - January 2021</h2>
            <section class="description">

                <p> 
                    Back in highschool, my friends and I sometimes played a 2 layered TicTacToe game wrongfully named "2D TicTacToe". It was one big TicTacToe and each box, another
                    smaller TicTacToe. The idea is that if you place your X/O in for example the center square of the smaller TicTacToe, then your opponent has to play their next move
                    in the center of the bigger TicTacToe (In blue as shown). When you win a smaller TicTacToe, that entire square becomes yours. To win the game, you have to have 3
                    of your X/O in a row in the bigger TicTacToe, just like usual TicTacToe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We often joked about how "3D" TicTacToe would look like but after some courses about algorithms and recursion from university, I realized I could generalize the rules
                    of the game for "n-D" TicTacToe. So I spent a couple hours explaining it how it would work to my friends and we collaborated to create this game. Here are some of the
                    features of the game.
                </p>

                <img src="./Files/TicTacToe-screenshot2.png" alt="A picture of my game" id="tictactoe-screenshot2">

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Generation: The TicTacToe boxes are recursively generated based on how many layers you put as the argument. Theoretically, you can put any number in it 
                        but practically, the limit is 4 layers because our computers takes a while to create 9^5 = 59049 boxes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Rules: After every player move, the script checks if the move wins them the smallest box by checking if there are 3 symbols in a row. If the player's move wins them
                        a box, the script will recursively check if the win causes the the player to also win the upper layer of TicTacToe. This process repeats until there are no wins
                        or it recurses to the largest TicTacToe layer.
                    </li>

                    <li> 
                        Player Moves: There's a turn based system that allows the player to place their symbol in any of the highlighted squares. While hovering, it also highlights the square
                        the opponent will have to play in on their next turn.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Server: After the singeplayer game was done, I took it upon myself to transform it into a multiplayer game using TCP. I created a server tha can host a main lobby
                        where players can create game lobbies, set up the number of layers and face each other. Every action sends a message to my server where it updates the game/lobby
                        state and sends the info to other players to also update their game/lobby state.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Afterwards, my friends and I were able to enjoy a couple games of 2D TicTacToe online before we realized that we aren't smart enough to play such an intellectual game.</p>
